## üöÄ Introduction

**EIII_COVID** is a chilling *Survival Horror* game developed in **Unity 3D** with **C#**. This project is not just a game, but the culmination of a **Final Degree Project**, awarded a **perfect score of 10/10**. Get ready for a deep dive into the Cybernetic Research Module (MIC), a real university environment meticulously recreated in 3D, now turned into the epicenter of a terrifying viral mutation.

## üìú Story & Setting

Set during the turbulent days of the **COVID-19** pandemic, the **[Cybernetic Research Module (MIC)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ETBo1set8XJZKfSr7)**, a real building next to the School of Engineering at the University of Le√≥n, Spain, has been repurposed for urgent vaccine research. Brave volunteers participate in clinical trials. However, hope turns to horror when an experiment goes catastrophically wrong, unleashing an **extremely aggressive viral mutation**.

As the player, you are trapped in this biological nightmare. Your mission is to navigate the dangerous MIC facilities, face mutant horrors, uncover the truth behind the outbreak, and, above all, fight for your survival.
